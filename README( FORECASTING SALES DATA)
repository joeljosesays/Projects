OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to build a forecasting system to predict demand of products for 3-months at different store locations based on the historical data.

INTRODUCTION
The dataset used is the item-sales at different stores from 2013 till 2017. The idea is to predict the sale of an item at a particular store for the next 3 â€“ month using a reliable forecasting model.

ACTIVITY
Approached the problem with suitable reference materials provided as well as with the help of external resources available from the internet. Performed day-to-day activities and elaborated through daily activity report to complete the entire project.

METHODOLOGY
1) Framed the problem
2) Collected the data
3) Preprocessed the data
4) Data analysis
5) Compared two models ARIMA and SARIMA
5) Selected SARIMA because of seasonal feature in the data.
6) Optimized the model by hyperparameter tuning and selected the best tuned feature by comparing RSME value.
7) Validated the residuals by comparing with FBPROPHET Forecasting Model.
8) Predicted the sales for next 3 - months
