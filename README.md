HOTEL BOOKING PREDICTION

ABSTRACT

The selected dataset is of hotel bookings which consist of 119391 observations and 32 features. It contains various information from two hotels, a City hotel, and one resort respectively. The dataset consists of information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, or babies, the number of parking spaces available, etc. The aim of our project is to analyze the given data from both hotels and conclude whether the given booking is going to be cancelled or not with respect to the given data. The predicted model is a binary classification problem wherein the given datasets are being trained and tested with different algorithms to get accurate results. After the model creation, we will be able to predict the reservation status within the limits that the booking should be or will be within one year. Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining to hotel or customer identification were deleted. Due to the scarcity of real business data for scientific and educational purposes, these datasets can have an important role for research and education in revenue management, machine learning, or data mining, as well as in other fields.
